# Often encountered issues. 
## PYTHONPATH
When a python script cannot recognize the imported project package: should add the path to the parent project to $PYTHONPATH, write it in the !/.bashrc, and source it.
## Default python interpreter
The default python interpreter is the same one as the env used in the terminal in the vscode.
